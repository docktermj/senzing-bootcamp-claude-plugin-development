"""A standalone snapshot offers an entity, then answers "no such entity" for its Records.

The snapshot embeds `graph` **capped** at ``GRAPH_NODE_CAP`` (1500) and embeds `merges` and
every aggregate drill-down list on their own terms. The Records shim indexed
``__DATA__.graph.nodes`` and nothing else, so an entity the page itself still offered — through
the "Show all merged entities" browse, a histogram bucket, a cross-source cell, a match-key row
or the largest-entities list — came back as
``{"entity_id": "1501", "error": "not found: no such entity"}`` whenever the cap had dropped
its node. Browsable and then denied, with no cap stated anywhere in the denial (#675).

⚠️ **The Truth Set (84 entities) never reaches the cap**, so no Module 3b walk can see this; it
appears only on a bootcamper's own data in Module 7. Hence a fixture built past the cap on
purpose, with entities that are reachable through each retained surface *and* ranked out of the
graph payload.

What is pinned:

* Every entity a retained snapshot surface offers resolves offline, whether or not the graph
  cap kept its node — the records index is built from that whole census, not from `graph.nodes`.
* The caps themselves are unchanged: the graph still renders at most ``GRAPH_NODE_CAP`` nodes
  and says it is capped, and the 200-per-list aggregate caps and their flags still hold. The
  repair is to the lookup denominator, never to what is shown.
* No record array is embedded twice: the index carries only entities whose records no other
  embedded surface already carries.
* The live-only `why` / `how` / `search` disclosures are untouched.

The lookup is exercised by **transcribing the shipped shim** into ``resolve()`` below rather
than running a browser or a JS engine: the guarantee is which surfaces the index is built from,
and neither is available on every machine that runs this suite (INV-052/INV-066).
``TheShimIndexesEveryRetainedSurface`` pins the transcription against the shipped source, so the
two cannot drift apart silently.
