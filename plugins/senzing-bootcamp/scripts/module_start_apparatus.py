"""Shared builder for the module-start apparatus reminder (#851, INV-420).

The module-start apparatus (the banner, journey map, before/after framing, step overview,
time estimate and model/effort nudge) is required at every content-module start and at
graduation, and only the model's attention enforced it: one session skipped it at five of
eight module starts. Two hooks now put a deterministic reminder into the guide's context at
the moment it is due:

- ``module-start-reminder.py`` (``UserPromptSubmit``), on the reply to a transition or
  graduation question;
- ``session-start.py`` (``SessionStart``), on a resume into a module that has not begun.

Both build the reminder here, so its wording is stated once and the two cannot drift
(INV-300). The rules it summarizes are owned by ``ground-rules.md`` ("Module start banners
and transitions"), ``module-completion.md`` (Step 4 and "Reaching graduation") and the
invariants cited in the text; this file only points the guide at them when they are due.

It also holds the finished-bootcamp rule, ``bootcamp_complete()`` (#905): the flag in either
the progress file or the preferences file, so every hook that asks "is the bootcamp over?"
reads the same answer.

It also holds each module's display name by state token (``DISPLAY_NAMES``, #874), so
``session-start.py`` names the recorded module in its resume message rather than leaving the
guide to improvise a name, which it did from the skill heading, number included (INV-079).

Every reminder is conditional, so it never turns a "not yet" into a module start, and it
is ASCII-only: ``session-start.py`` prints it as plain text, and a non-ASCII character on a
Windows console code page would raise instead of printing.

This is NOT a hook. Python puts each hook script's own directory (this ``scripts/``
directory) on ``sys.path``, so ``import module_start_apparatus`` resolves here on Linux,
macOS and Windows alike. Standard library only (INV-052). Nothing here raises on a missing,
empty or malformed progress or preferences file.
