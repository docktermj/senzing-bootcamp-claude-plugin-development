"""Capture one screenshot per tab of a bootcamp visualization, for the recap.

Best-effort and dependency-optional (INV-052/INV-066): this helper renders a
**local** HTML file (or a localhost URL served by the bundled visualization app)
to one PNG **per tab**, so the graduation recap PDF can show what the bootcamper
actually built. It tries several headless backends in order and uses the first
that works; if none is available it exits with code 2 so the caller degrades
gracefully — keeping the HTML link and never blocking graduation (INV-122).

⛔ **One capture per tab, never per viewport.** This script used to vary the
browser window size across a single page load — ``(1280,800)``, ``(1280,1600)``,
``(1024,768)`` — and had no interaction step at all, so every image showed
whichever tab was active by default. Three files were written, the script exited
0, and nothing looked wrong; the recap shipped three near-identical Entity Graph
shots with captions describing tabs that were never captured. Tab diversity was
not achievable, so the captions could not have been right.

Two consequences are designed in here:

* Output is named ``<name>-<tab-slug>.png``. A tab-named file makes a drifting
  caption structurally hard, and lets graduation's screenshot backfill map images
  to sections and tabs deterministically instead of by guesswork.
* Each written path is printed with its human tab label, tab-separated, so the
  caller derives the caption from the capture rather than from its plan.

How a tab is selected, without adding a browser-automation dependency:

* ``--url http://localhost:PORT`` — appended as ``?tab=<id>``, which the
  visualization app honors on load (``applyDeepLink``). ``--query`` adds ``&q=``
  so Search / Probe can be captured showing real results against the live engine.
* ``--html path/to/snapshot.html`` — a temp sibling copy is written with a small
  script injected before ``</body>`` that calls the app's own ``activate(<id>)``
  (falling back to clicking ``#navbtn-<id>``), retrying until the app's async
  init settles. Temp copies are always deleted.

Because selection happens *in the page*, every backend below works per tab —
including the ones with no interaction API.

Offline guarantee (INV-091): only local files and ``localhost``/``127.0.0.1``
URLs are ever opened. A non-local ``http(s)`` host is refused — this helper
never fetches from the network.

Backends tried, in order (each optional):
  1. Playwright (``playwright`` + a browser) — ``python3 -m pip install playwright``.
  2. Selenium (``selenium`` + a headless Chrome/Firefox driver).
  3. Headless Chrome/Chromium CLI (``--headless --screenshot``).
  4. ``wkhtmltoimage`` CLI.

Usage::

    # static snapshot, all applicable tabs
    python3 capture_screenshots.py --html docs/visualizations/foo.html \
        --out-dir docs/visualizations --name foo

    # live server, specific tabs, with a real search for Search / Probe
    python3 capture_screenshots.py --url http://localhost:8080 \
        --name results_visualization --tabs graph,stats,probe --query "Acme"

On success it prints one ``<png path>\\t<tab label>`` line per capture and exits 0.
Exit codes: 0 = wrote at least one PNG; 2 = no headless capability available
(caller should skip screenshots); 1 = bad arguments.

``--html <snapshot> --verify-scale`` captures nothing: it checks the snapshot's interactive
Entity Graph at a 480px pane when the graph is capped (#883) and prints one
``scale-check: <check>\\t<status>\\t<detail>`` line per check. Exit codes there: 0 = passed (or
the graph is not capped), 1 = a check failed, 2 = skipped (no headless Chrome/Chromium/Edge),
3 = a check could not be exercised. See "Scale check" below.

    and only one runs per path: the snapshot path injects ``activate()`` with a
    ``#navbtn-`` click fallback (``_ACTIVATE_JS``), while a live server is driven ONLY by
    the ``?tab=`` deep link (``_tab_url``). A server that implements the tab set, the
    section ids and the nav ids but omits deep-linking therefore serves its DEFAULT tab
    for every request — and every earlier check still passes, because the ids it looks
    for are all present. The run then writes one correctly-named PNG per tab, all of the
    same tab, reports success for each, and the images reach the recap captioned as tabs
    they do not show. Measured on 2026-08-28 against a Java server built to the contract:
    six files, five distinct images, two byte-identical, exit 0.

    ⚠️ **A source-level check, deliberately, and its limit is stated rather than hidden.**
    It proves the page reads the query string; it cannot prove the page honors ``tab``
    correctly. Verifying the RENDERED result would need a backend that can evaluate script
    against a live URL — Playwright or Selenium — and neither is a bootcamp requirement,
    while the headless-Chrome CLI that does the capturing cannot evaluate an expression for
    us (see ``_measure_chrome_cli``, which has to patch a local file to read one number).
    So this catches the failure that actually occurs — no deep-linking at all — and cannot

    honor the contract at `visualization-api-reference.md`'s "Tab identifiers and

    ``tab-<id>`` element, exhausts its retries, and the **default** tab is captured — so
    e.g. ``viz-feature-scores.png`` would contain the Entity Graph. A file named for a
    tab it does not show is the exact defect tab-naming exists to prevent, so a tab that
    is not in the page is skipped and reported rather than captured wrongly.

    A tab hidden at runtime by ``tabApplicable`` still has its ``tab-<id>`` section in
    the markup and still activates, so this only rejects genuinely absent tabs — a
    suppressed one is caught by ``_tabs_applicable`` instead, and the two are kept apart
    on purpose: **absent** means the tab inventory has drifted (a real problem), while
    **suppressed** means this dataset does not have that tab's data (routine). Reporting

    injected JS and serialize the DOM. This works for the `file://` pages the bootcamp

    to a viewport capture with an honest label rather than guessing a height.

    ⛔ **`--window-size` is not the viewport, and the difference silently crops.** Under
    `--headless=new` Chrome reserves window chrome, so a requested 1440×900 window renders
    an 813px viewport while the screenshot comes out 900px tall — the extra being blank
    padding. Screenshotting at exactly `scrollHeight` therefore loses the last ~87px of a

# Scale check (#883): the snapshot's INTERACTIVE graph, checked before capture
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
#
# Every check above is about the capture render (`?capture=1`). A bootcamper opens the
# snapshot itself, at whatever size their window is, and at full scale three things broke
# there that no Truth Set capture could show (#883): the graph opened unfitted, with most of a
# 1,500-node layout outside a narrow pane; a stylesheet rule painted every relationship edge
# gray over the colors the renderer had written; and an entity the snapshot offered past the
# graph cap had once answered "not found" for its records (#675). `--verify-scale` loads the
# snapshot in headless Chrome, lets its own interactive layout run to its first settle, and
# checks those three in the DOM, so Module 7 keeps screenshots only of a snapshot that passed.
#
# ⚠️ **What makes the interactive path observable here at all.** Headless virtual time does
# not service `requestAnimationFrame`, so an animated layout advances ~5 of its ~300 ticks and
# never reaches its own settle (INV-298) -- the reason the capture has a synchronous render.
# The check must not use that render: it is testing what the reader gets. So the injected head
# script routes animation frames through `setTimeout`, which virtual time DOES advance, before
# the page's own scripts load (d3 binds `requestAnimationFrame` when it loads). The page's code
# is otherwise untouched; its own settle signal says when the first fit has happened.
#
# ⚠️ **Generator-neutral by construction.** It reads only what the any-language contract
# fixes: the `tab-graph` / `tab-probe` sections and `activate()` (INV-124), the
# `data-graph-settled` signal (INV-298), the capped note's wording, the "Show only entities
# with relationships" toggle, the "Show all merged entities" browse and the "Records" action
# (visualization-api-reference.md). A Java or C# app's snapshot is checked the same way, and
# `TheCheckerReadsAnyGeneratorsSnapshot` in the #883 test proves it on a hand-written page. One
# exception: node LABELS are found by the reference's `node` / `node-labels` classes, which the
# contract does not fix, so on another generator's snapshot the fit check measures every node
# marker and no label.
