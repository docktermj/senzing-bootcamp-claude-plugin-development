"""Shared detector: is the prompt being submitted a reply to the module transition question?

Two ``UserPromptSubmit`` hooks act on the Bootcamper's reply to the pinned transition question
("Are you ready to move on to the next module: {name}?", module-completion.md Step 4) or the
graduation offer (module-completion.md "Reaching graduation"):

- ``module-start-reminder.py`` (#851) reminds the guide of the module-start apparatus;
- ``checkpoint-tick.py`` (#858) reminds the guide of a required record module completion left
  missing.

Both detect that reply here, so there is one detector and the two cannot disagree about
which turn is a transition (#858). ``offered_module(payload)`` is the entry point; the record
helpers below it are what it is built from.

A third hook, ``module-number-reminder.py`` (#874), reads the same previous turn through
``previous_turn_texts(payload)``: every assistant text of it, not only the final message,
with the same gates 1 and 2 below. It shares the reader rather than carrying a second one.

How the reply is recognized, gate by gate; every failed gate returns None:
  1. The payload is a JSON object with a string ``transcript_path`` naming a readable,
     UTF-8 transcript.
  2. The previous turn has settled on a final assistant message: not a tool call, not a
     tool result. Sidechain (subagent) and meta records are not the user-facing turn and
     are skipped. The prompt being submitted is skipped if it is already on disk.
  3. That message's last 👉 line is one of the two pinned questions.

The reply itself is not classified: what each hook does with a "not yet" is its own
decision. Biased toward silence like ``stop-nudge.py`` (INV-054): anything undecided returns
None, and nothing here raises on bad input.

This is NOT a hook. Python puts each hook script's own directory (this ``scripts/``
directory) on ``sys.path``, so ``import transition_reply`` resolves here on Linux, macOS and
Windows alike. Standard library only (INV-052).
